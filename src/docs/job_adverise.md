About the Team

Over the past year, we have experienced a significant increase in demand for OpenAI's hands-on technical expertise to translate abstract ideas into production applications. We’ve established a Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) team who will work closely with our most strategic customers to deeply understand their use cases and design, build, and implement products for them. As one of our founding FDSWEs, you will deploy these solutions on customer infrastructure for the world's most influential businesses, driving real business impact through our newest models and our own innovations in technical delivery.

About the Role

We are looking for customer-focused software engineers to build effective custom software that leverages OpenAI’s APIs to solve real customer problems. As an FDSWE, you will work with our customers and OpenAI Forward Deployed Engineers to design and implement scalable solutions that solve their most difficult problems. You will design abstractions to solve customer problems, and then use them to scale our speed and quality of delivery across all Forward Deployed engagements.


You will collaborate closely with Sales, Solutions Engineering, Solutions Architects, and Customer Success Managers who work on the same account. You will also work with our Research and Applied Product and Engineering teams to provide insightful customer feedback.

Collaborate closely with Sales, Technical Success, and Applied teams to ensure seamless customer experiences, project success and actionable product feedback

Contribute to internal knowledge bases, codifying best practices and sharing insights gained from customer engagements to scale the Forward Deployed Engineering function.

You’ll thrive in this role if you:

7+ years of professional engineering experience (excluding internships) in relevant roles at tech and product-driven companies - customer-facing experience is highly desirable

Are willing to travel up to 50% and work on-site with customers to build strong relationships and deeply understand their needs.
