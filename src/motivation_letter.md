# Motivation Letter

Dear Hiring Manager at Vitol,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack (C#/.Net) Developer position at Vitol as advertised. Your leadership in the energy and commodity markets, combined with your innovative approach to analytics and technology, deeply resonates with my passion for leveraging technology to solve complex global challenges.

At Vitol, I appreciate your commitment to building scalable, data-driven platforms and fostering a flat hierarchy that empowers individual contributionsâ€”values that align perfectly with my own professional approach. With more than 18 years of experience leading software architecture, cloud-native development, and AI integration, I have successfully transformed legacy systems into agile, microservices-based platforms, much like the global analytics systems you develop.

In my current role as CTO at IBV Solutions, I led the development of an open-source AI platform and implemented Kubernetes-based microservices, enhancing scalability and resilience. I thrive in team-oriented environments where close collaboration and innovative solutions are encouraged. I am confident that my full stack development expertise, coupled with strong skills in C#/.Net, cloud technologies, and real-time analytics, would allow me to significantly contribute to your analytics team.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my technical skills and entrepreneurial spirit to Vitol and help drive your mission to orchestrate global energy flows with cutting-edge analytics. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value to your team.

Sincerely,  
Gian Paolo Santopaolo
